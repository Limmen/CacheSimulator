#				Java Cachesimulator

##What is it?
---------------

A school project on a course in Object-Oriented Programming and Design (Java).
We where given a sample GUI and a program specifikation.
This assignment was not a group-projet, it was done singlehanded on a time-span of 2 weeks.

##Program architecture
--------------------
Obviously, since this was a course in Object-Oriented programming and design we had a focus on the program architecture and design. This program is created in the MVC pattern (Model-View-Controller) with a intent that every class and function has a good cohesion, low coupling and a well-defined public interface

##Functionality
--------------
The program is a simple cachesimulator with a GUI that lets the user
enter a nickname and than specify the details of the Cache-memory he want to work on (Block Size, Associativity, Block Count).

When cache is set up you can executing STORE/LOAD instrutions at different addresses. While executing, the GUI will show whether the instruction was a hit or a miss.

##Documentation
--------------
The code is well documented but if you have any questions you can contact me on Kimham@kth.se
